# ModernCV - 

A template used to generate my CV. 

## Description

Moderncv provides a documentclass for typesetting curricula vitae in various
styles. Moderncv aims to be both straightforward to use and customizable,
providing five ready-made styles (classic, casual, banking, oldstyle and fancy)
and allowing one to define his own by modifying colors, fonts, icons, etc.

Most commands are defined in such a way that arguments are optional.

Until a decent manual is written, one can always look in the "examples"
directory for some examples. Documents can be compiled into dvi, ps or pdf.
